# Module Cleanup Record

## Date: 2025-01-18

### Modules Removed (Unused)
- `pulsepal/syntax_validator.py` - No imports found, functionality not needed
- `pulsepal/recitation_monitor.py` - No imports found, functionality not needed  
- `pulsepal/rag_optimization.py` - No imports found, functionality not needed
- `pulsepal/rag_performance.py` - No imports found, functionality not needed
- `pulsepal/env_validator.py` - No imports found, functionality not needed
- `pulsepal/markdown_fix_post_processor.py` - No imports found, functionality not needed
- `pulsepal/timeout_utils.py` - No imports found, functionality not needed

### Modules Relocated
- `pulsepal/debug_analyzer.py` → `tests/debug_analyzer.py` - Used only by tests
- `pulsepal/code_patterns.py` → `tests/code_patterns.py` - Used only by tests
- `pulsepal/concept_mapper.py` → `tests/concept_mapper.py` - Used only by tests

### Import Updates
- Updated test files to use local imports
- Fixed relative imports in relocated modules

### Validation Results
- ✅ CLI startup successful
- ✅ Main pulsepal imports successful
- ✅ No ModuleNotFoundError in core functionality
- ⚠️ Some test failures exist but unrelated to module removal

### Justification
All removed modules had zero imports across the codebase and were not providing essential functionality. The relocated modules were only used in tests and moving them to the test directory improves code organization.
