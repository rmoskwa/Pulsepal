# Summary for Refactoring PRD

This brownfield analysis reveals a codebase in transition from v1 to v2 architecture, with incomplete migration leaving broken tests and unused modules. The core functionality works but is obscured by technical debt. Key refactoring priorities:

1. **Test Infrastructure**: 5+ test files broken due to outdated imports
2. **Dead Code**: 5-10 modules confirmed unused or barely used
3. **Naming Consistency**: Remove v2 suffixes now that v1 is gone
4. **Session Management**: 500+ log files need cleanup strategy
5. **Documentation**: Update to reflect current architecture

The refactoring effort should focus on cleaning up the incomplete v1â†’v2 migration, removing dead code, and establishing clear module boundaries for maintainability.
