# Performance and Optimization Opportunities

## Current Performance Characteristics
- Semantic router loads 80MB model (cached after first load)
- RAG service uses hybrid search (vector + keyword)
- Session management maintains conversation history
- No apparent caching of RAG results

## Optimization Opportunities
1. Implement RAG result caching
2. Optimize conversation history storage
3. Consider lazy loading for heavy modules
4. Add performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks
