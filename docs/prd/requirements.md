# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- **FR1**: The system shall update all test imports to reference the correct v2 modules (main_agent_v2, rag_service_v2, tools_v2)
- **FR2**: The system shall remove all confirmed unused modules (syntax_validator, recitation_monitor, rag_optimization, rag_performance, env_validator)
- **FR3**: The system shall rename v2 modules to remove version suffixes once v1 references are eliminated
- **FR4**: The system shall implement automatic session log rotation to prevent unlimited growth of conversationLogs directory
- **FR5**: The system shall update all documentation to reflect the current single-agent architecture
- **FR6**: The system shall ensure all tests in the test suite pass successfully
- **FR7**: The system shall maintain backward compatibility for existing API endpoints and CLI interfaces

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1**: All refactoring changes must maintain existing performance characteristics with response times under 2 seconds for typical queries
- **NFR2**: The refactored codebase must maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing Chainlit and CLI interfaces
- **NFR3**: Test execution time should not increase by more than 20% after refactoring
- **NFR4**: Session log storage should not exceed 1GB with automatic cleanup of logs older than 30 days
- **NFR5**: Code coverage should reach at least 80% after test fixes are complete

## Compatibility Requirements

- **CR1**: All existing API endpoints must continue to function without changes to request/response formats
- **CR2**: Database schema must remain unchanged to maintain compatibility with existing Supabase vector storage
- **CR3**: UI/UX must remain consistent - no changes to Chainlit interface or CLI command structure
- **CR4**: Integration with Google Gemini API and Supabase must maintain current authentication and configuration patterns
