# Implementation Notes

## Story Sequencing Rationale
This sequence minimizes risk by fixing tests first (providing a safety net), then removing dead code (reducing complexity), implementing new features (session management), completing the migration (renaming), and finally updating documentation. Each story can be completed independently while maintaining system stability.

## Critical Success Factors
1. Maintain zero downtime during refactoring
2. Preserve all existing functionality
3. Improve code maintainability metrics
4. Establish sustainable development practices
5. Enable future feature development on clean foundation

## Post-Implementation Validation
- All tests passing with >80% coverage
- No orphaned or unused modules remaining
- Consistent naming throughout codebase
- Session logs under control with rotation
- Documentation fully updated and accurate
