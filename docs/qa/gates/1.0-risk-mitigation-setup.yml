notes: |
  Excellent implementation of risk mitigation infrastructure. The development team has successfully
  addressed all critical risks identified in the risk assessment. The backup system is robust with
  checksum verification, rollback procedures are well-documented and tested, and the CI/CD pipeline
  provides appropriate automation while maintaining safety through manual deployment triggers.
  
  Minor recommendations for future enhancements are non-blocking and can be addressed in subsequent
  iterations. The team should be commended for the thorough approach to risk mitigation.
  
  Ready to proceed with Story 2.0 module refactoring with confidence in the safety net provided.
