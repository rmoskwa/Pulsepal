## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests (Must Pass Before Production)
1. **Module Import Validation Suite**
   - Test all import paths after each rename
   - Verify no circular dependencies
   - Check lazy loading where implemented
   - Run time: ~5 minutes per module

2. **Data Migration Tests**
   - Validate all 500+ sessions migrate correctly
   - Check file integrity post-migration
   - Verify session continuity
   - Run time: ~30 minutes full suite

3. **Rollback Tests**
   - Test rollback for each story independently
   - Verify system recovery to previous state
   - Measure recovery time (target <5 minutes)
   - Document rollback procedures

4. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end tests after each module change
   - API endpoint validation
   - CLI command verification
   - RAG service functionality

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests (Should Pass Before Production)
1. **Performance Tests**
   - Load testing with 1000+ session files
   - Session rotation under load
   - Response time validation (<2 seconds)
   - Resource usage monitoring

2. **Security Tests**
   - API key exposure scanning
   - Git history audit for secrets
   - Environment variable validation
   - Authentication flow testing

3. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Measure coverage after each test fix
   - Target 80% coverage before completion
   - Identify uncovered critical paths
   - Add tests for gaps

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests (Nice to Have)
1. **Documentation Validation**
   - Verify all code examples work
   - Check import statements in docs
   - Validate setup instructions

2. **Regression Tests**
   - Standard CLI functionality
   - Basic RAG queries
   - Session management basics

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Starting Refactoring)
1. **Create "Story 0: Risk Mitigation Setup"**
   - Implement comprehensive backup strategy
   - Document rollback procedures for each story
   - Set up basic CI/CD pipeline (even if manual)
   - Migrate API keys to .env

2. **Establish Testing Infrastructure**
   - Fix at least one test file to validate approach
   - Create import validation test suite
   - Set up coverage reporting

### Risk-Aware Story Sequencing (Modified)
1. **Story 0**: Risk Mitigation Setup (NEW - Critical)
2. **Story 1.1**: Fix Test Infrastructure (creates safety net)
3. **Story 1.3**: Session Management (high risk, do early with safety net)
4. **Story 1.2**: Remove Unused Modules (lower risk, good cleanup)
5. **Story 1.4**: Module Renaming (highest risk, do last)
6. **Story 1.5**: Documentation Update (low risk, final cleanup)

### Development Process Recommendations
1. **Daily Practices**
   - Create backup before each day's work
   - Run import validation after each change
   - Commit working state frequently

2. **Story Completion Criteria**
   - All related tests passing
   - No import errors
   - Performance metrics unchanged
   - Rollback procedure tested

### Monitoring Requirements

**Real-time Monitoring (Production)**
- Import errors (alert threshold: any occurrence)
- Response time (alert threshold: >2 seconds)
- Session processing queue (alert threshold: >100 pending)
- Disk space usage (alert threshold: >80%)

**Daily Monitoring**
- Test suite execution status
- Coverage metrics trend
- Error log analysis
- Session cleanup effectiveness

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Go/No-Go Decision Points

**After Story 0 (Risk Mitigation)**
- ✅ Backup strategy implemented
- ✅ Rollback procedures documented
- ✅ API keys migrated to .env
- ❌ If not complete: DO NOT PROCEED

**After Story 1.1 (Test Fixes)**
- ✅ At least 50% of tests passing
- ✅ Import validation suite working
- ❌ If <30% tests pass: STOP and reassess

**After Story 1.3 (Session Management)**
- ✅ 100% of sessions successfully migrated
- ✅ Performance unchanged
- ❌ If data loss detected: ROLLBACK immediately

**After Story 1.4 (Module Renaming)**
- ✅ All imports resolved
- ✅ Full regression test passed
- ❌ If production errors: ROLLBACK to v2 files

### Accepted Risks (With Mitigation)
1. **WSL2 Chainlit Testing Limitation**
   - Accept: Document workaround using CLI testing only
   - Mitigation: Manual testing checklist for Chainlit

2. **Temporary Code Duplication**
   - Accept: Parallel v2 files during transition
   - Mitigation: Clear timeline for removal (2 weeks max)

3. **Limited Rollback Window**
   - Accept: Rollback only viable within 24 hours
   - Mitigation: Extensive validation before commitment

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Any critical risk mitigation fails
- New dependencies discovered during refactoring
- Performance degradation >20% observed
- Test coverage drops below 60%
- Story sequence needs adjustment

## Conclusion

**Overall Risk Assessment**: HIGH RISK (Score: 29/100)

This refactoring carries significant risk due to:
1. Broken testing infrastructure (no safety net)
2. Complex module interdependencies
3. Large-scale data migration requirement
4. No existing CI/CD or rollback procedures

**Recommendation**: PROCEED WITH CAUTION

Before starting Story 1.1, it is **critical** to implement Story 0 (Risk Mitigation Setup). The current state of the system (broken tests, no CI/CD, manual deployment) makes this refactoring particularly hazardous without proper safety measures.

**Success Probability**: 
- Without risk mitigation: 40%
- With recommended mitigations: 85%

The refactoring is achievable but requires disciplined execution of risk mitigation strategies and careful monitoring at each stage.
