      "description": "MIMOSA (Multiple-tissue Isotropic Multi-parametric MRI Of brain using Self-supervised Algorithm) sequence for 3T scanners with 1mm isotropic resolution. This sequence implements a sophisticated multi-contrast acquisition strategy with variable acceleration factors (R=3.26 to 11.75) using CPLM-optimized spiral trajectories, enabling rapid quantitative T1/T2/PD mapping in 3-4 minutes. Designed for integration with zero-shot self-supervised learning reconstruction.",
